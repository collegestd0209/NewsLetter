                <p> In addition, the coastal road connector to Bandra-Worli sea link is expected to be opened by July-end, the sources added. Initially only the south-bound arm will be opened for traffic in both directions, while work on placing three girders on the north-ound carriageway will continue, said a civic official, adding: "This would mean that traffic from two lanes on the bridge connecting to Bandra-Worli sea link would converge into four lanes. This would ease traffic movement even more allowing signal-free travel for motorists from Marine Drive to Bandra."</p>
